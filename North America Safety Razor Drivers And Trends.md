North America Safety Razor Market Drivers and Trends
The North American safety razor market is being driven by an increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly grooming solutions. Consumers are shifting away from disposable razors due to environmental concerns, preferring products that are reusable and reduce plastic waste. The growing awareness of the environmental impact of single-use plastic razors has led to a higher adoption of safety razors, which offer durability and are made from recyclable materials.
