Furthermore, electron guns find extensive application in the field of display technologies, particularly in cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and flat-panel displays. CRTs were once ubiquitous in televisions and computer monitors, where electron guns were crucial in generating the electron beams that illuminate phosphor screens. Although CRT technology has largely been replaced by LCD and OLED displays, electron guns continue to play a role in specialized applications such as high-energy physics experiments and particle accelerators.

In addition to microscopy, semiconductor manufacturing, and display technologies, electron guns are also employed in vacuum coating processes. Vacuum coating involves depositing thin films of various materials onto substrates under vacuum conditions. Electron guns are used to evaporate or sputter the coating material, providing precise control over the deposition process. This application is essential in industries ranging from optics and automotive to aerospace, where surface properties such as reflectivity, conductivity, and durability are critical.

Lastly, electron guns have applications in diverse scientific and industrial research settings where beam heating, welding, and material processing require controlled electron beam sources. These applications span fields as varied as metallurgy, electronics, and environmental sciences, showcasing the versatility and utility of electron guns beyond traditional uses.
