As consumers seek healthier, pesticide-free products, there is a growing preference for biological and safer alternatives, thus boosting the adoption of kasugamycin-based products in agriculture. Additionally, increasing investments in research and development of kasugamycin formulations are expected to further accelerate market growth in the region.

Another key trend driving the market is the rising emphasis on sustainable agriculture and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies in North America.
