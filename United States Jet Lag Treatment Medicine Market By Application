Jet lag, a common phenomenon experienced by travelers crossing multiple time zones, has prompted the growth of the jet lag treatment medicine market in the United States. This market caters to various applications, each addressing specific needs of travelers and shift workers. The demand for jet lag treatment medicines is driven by the increasing frequency of international travel and the consequent disruption of circadian rhythms. This market is characterized by a variety of products including melatonin supplements, prescription medications, and over-the-counter remedies tailored to alleviate symptoms associated with jet lag.

Major applications of jet lag treatment medicines include their use by frequent flyers, international travelers, and individuals experiencing shift work-related sleep disorders.
